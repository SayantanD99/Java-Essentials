#Interfaces in Java

Interfaces are very crucial to the Java Programming language. 

With the use of interfaces we can enhance the code readability and code reusability.

Interfaces contain abstract methods which gets completed in the implementing class.

I have shown two simple programs depicting the use of interfaces.

Program 1 - Phone interface

Program 2 - Game interface

If you have any suggestions, do let me know.

Thank You !
